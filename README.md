# Udacity Project: CIFAR-10 Image Classifier
## Nanodegree (Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch)

### Description
Udacity project to build an image classifier using PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy (50.7%). Then compare the model with a fictitious company's model in terms of performance.

### Steps Performed -
1. Transformations on the data.
2. Exploration of the data.
3. Definition of network architecture, loss function & optimizer.
4. Training of the network.
5. Plotting of the training loss, validation loss & validation accuracy.
6. Testing of the model.
7. Saving of the model.
8. Comparison with a fictitious model.
9. Suggestions to improve model performance.

### Install
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

Also requires a software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Files
This project contains three files:

- `image_classifier.ipynb`: Main file with my implementation.
- `report.html`: HTML file of the ipynb notebook.
- `checkpoint.pth`: Final model parameters saved.

### Code
Template code & implementation is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file are required to complete the work. While some code has already been implemented, additional functionality is implemented where requested to successfully complete the project. Code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate.

### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
CIFAR-10 has 10 classes with 6,000 images of each class. These classes are -
